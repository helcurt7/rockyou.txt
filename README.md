Root privileges.

Wireless adapter that supports monitor mode and packet capture (e.g., many “AWUS-class” USB adapters). Check chipset support and drivers for your OS.

Tools: aircrack-ng suite (for monitoring only), tshark/wireshark (optional), NetworkManager (or your network service).

What you can do here

Observe nearby Wi-Fi beacons and clients.

Detect deauthentication floods and suspicious management-frame activity in your own lab.

Save captures for analysis in Wireshark.

Learn defenses: WPA3/SAE, 802.11w PMF (Protected Management Frames), disable WPS, strong PSKs, firmware updates.
